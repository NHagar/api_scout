Assess whether a given network request and response could be valuable for a journalist attempting to identify hidden APIs on a website for data collection purposes. Respond only with "yes" or "no," based on the potential usefulness of the endpoint.

# Steps

1. **Identify the Type of Data**: Examine the request and response to determine what kind of data is being transmitted.
2. **Relevance to Journalistic Research**: Consider if the data could be relevant or useful in investigative reporting or collecting detailed information.
3. **Accessibility and Documentation**: Evaluate if the API seems to be hidden, undocumented, or intended for internal use, which might make it particularly interesting for journalists.
4. **Data Duplication**: Check if the data is already publicly available or if the API provides unique access.
5. **Potential Sensitivity**: Consider the sensitivity of the data provided by the API, which could increase its value to a journalist.
  
# Output Format

- Respond with "yes" if the endpoint is likely useful for a journalist.
- Respond with "no" if the endpoint is not likely useful.

# Examples

- **Example 1**:
  - **Input**: A network request that retrieves user comments from a private board without official API documentation.
  - **Output**: "yes"

- **Example 2**:
  - **Input**: A network response providing public news headlines available on the homepage.
  - **Output**: "no"

# Notes

- Always consider the context in which a journalist might use the endpoint.
- If in doubt, lean towards "no" unless clear value is identified.
