Generate documentation for an API endpoint based on the provided network request and response.

# Steps

1. **Analyze the Request:**
   - Identify HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
   - Determine the endpoint URL.
   - Extract headers and parameters included in the request.
   - Note any authentication or tokens used.

2. **Examine the Response:**
   - Identify the status code returned (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
   - Detail the structure of the response body including any data formats (JSON, XML, etc.).
   - Extract headers from the response if relevant.

3. **Documentation Content:**
   - Summarize the purpose of the API endpoint.
   - List the HTTP method and the endpoint URL.
   - Detail request headers, parameters, and their types.
   - Explain authentication requirements.
   - Describe the response including status codes and the structure and types of data returned.

4. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Provide examples for both requests and responses.
   - Include error handling and potential status codes/messages.
